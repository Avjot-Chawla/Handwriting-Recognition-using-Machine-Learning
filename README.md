# Handwriting Recognition Using CNNs

## Overview
Handwriting recognition is a crucial field with applications in automated data entry, document digitization, form processing, and assistive technologies. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based handwriting recognition system that accurately identifies handwritten numbers (0-9) and alphabets (A-Z) across various handwriting styles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Technology & Approach
- **Machine Learning Model:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their superior performance in image-based tasks, are used to recognize characters.
- **Dataset:** Handwritten digits and alphabets are collected from diverse sources to improve recognition across different handwriting styles.
- **Preprocessing:** Techniques like grayscale conversion, normalization, and Gaussian blurring are applied to clean and standardize the input images.
- **Training:** The CNN model is trained using supervised learning, with optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to enhance accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the model's performance.

## Key Features
- **High Accuracy:** Capable of recognizing numbers and alphabets across different handwriting styles.
- **Robustness:** Tested against noisy inputs, varying font sizes, and slant angles.
- **Real-World Applications:** Useful for document digitization, automated data entry, and other AI-powered text recognition tasks.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset for improved generalization.
- Implementing real-time recognition with webcam input.
- Optimizing model performance for mobile and embedded systems.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in handwriting recognition, ensuring reliable and accurate character identification. With further optimizations, it can be integrated into real-world applications requiring automated text recognition.
